Makes links in NEWLY SAVED content dynamic (relaive to site directory). Allows content to survive domain or directory change. (Read warning!)
== Description ==
Makes all (src and href) links in newly saved posts stored as dynamic or relaive to home (by using placeholder). Content links now survive wordpress move across domains or directories. Site path is set through Settings>General page. Warning - in case of deinstallation, all content saved while this plugin was active will have [home] placeholder instead of site address part of links. You'll have to search/replace that through phpMyAdmin manually.
Based on Dynamic Links by Björn Ahrens.
